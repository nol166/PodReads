PodReads is an application that helps podcasters find sponsors for their shows and for advertisers to find a sensible place to target their ads. As a big podcast fan myself, I often find that advertisers miss a huge opportunity by choosing podcasters that don't exactly "mesh" with their mission. This is the story of PodReads.

This app was developed over a two week sprint for our capstone project at Galvanize. This project involved carful time management, agile workflow and most importantly a lot of coffee.

### What problem does it solve? ###
PodReads solves the problem of often mismatched ad reads that take place on podcasts that have a different target audience. PodReads helps podcasters find sponsors that match their target audience in a way that makes sense.

### How? ###
Advertisers can post information about their company while podcasters can share with advertisers what their show is about.  Each podcaster can display a preview of their latest episode to potential sponsors. Both parties have the ability to connect with each other and set up partnerships once they have created an account.
