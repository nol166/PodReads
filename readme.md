### What problem does it solve? ###
PodReads solves the problem of often mismatched ad reads that take place on podcasts that have a different target audience. PodReads helps podcasters find sponsors that match their target audience in a way that makes sense.

### How? ###
Advertisers can post information about their company while podcasters can share with advertisers what their show is about.  Each podcaster can display a preview of their latest episode to potential sponsors. Both parties have the ability to connect with each other and set up partnerships once they have created an account.

### Technologies used ###
Node, Express, Knex, AngularJS, Materialize CSS, PostgreSQL, Bcrypt, JSON Web Tokens, Stitcher, iTunes, Google Play.
